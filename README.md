A basic stage creator for Pac Man (or any other game) where the user can click on the tiles of a gameboard 
(25x25 used as default, but can be changed by changing the value of the variable gridsize in index.js) to indicate paths for the player. 
The generated designs can be saved to the local drive and loaded again later.
